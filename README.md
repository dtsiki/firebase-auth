### Installation & Setting up Firebase
Clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dtsiki/firebase-auth.git
$ cd firebase-auth
```

Install project dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Go to the Firebase website and create a Cloud Firestore database, then set up authentication (Sign-in method tab, Email/Password type). Then you need to get projectâ€™s configuration details: go back to the project overview and get the configuration details (apiKey, authDomain, databaseURL, etc). Create environment variable files .env in the root of your project and copy the configuration details into their environments:

```sh
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY=''
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=''
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=''
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=''
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=''
REACT_APP_APP_ID=''
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=''
```

In the project directory run:

```sh
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the profject in your browser.

If you are more of a fan of Yarn, you can use the following command instead:

```sh
yarn i
yarn start
```
